# CSS calc() Gotchas

This repository demonstrates some uncommon issues that can arise when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `calc()` function is powerful, but requires careful attention to detail to avoid unexpected results.

## Issues

* **Missing Units:** `calc()` requires units for all values, even if implicit (like `10px` instead of `10`). Missing units can lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Operator Precedence:** The standard mathematical order of operations applies, requiring parenthesis for complex calculations.
* **Property Compatibility:** Not all CSS properties play nicely with values dynamically generated by `calc()`. Careful testing is crucial.

## Solutions

* Always include units in `calc()` expressions.
* Use parenthesis to explicitly define the order of operations.
* Thoroughly test your `calc()` expressions across different browsers and devices.
