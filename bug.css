The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling.  For example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This works as expected. However, if you try something like:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10);
}
```

This might not work as you expect, potentially resulting in `0px` or other unexpected values due to missing units.  Similarly, more complex calculations might suffer from incorrect order of operations unless carefully parenthesized.

Another issue is the use of `calc()` with certain CSS properties and values. Certain properties might not support the values generated by `calc()`, potentially leading to unexpected rendering or errors.
